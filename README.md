## Ruby Basics & Enumerables (meets Beauty and the Beast)

### Question 1

Define a method called `offer_rose`, which should take one argument named `person`.

When called the method should `puts` "Would you take this rose, `person`, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from the bitter cold?"

Demonstrate calling the method, passing in "young prince" as the argument.

Write your code here:
```ruby
def offer_rose person
  puts "Would you take this rose, #{person}, in exchange for giving an old beggar woman shelter from
  the bitter cold?"

```

### Question 2

Assume the following hash:

```ruby
town = {
  residents: ["Maurice", "Belle", "Gaston"],
  castle: {
    num_rooms: 47,
    residents: "Robby Benson",
    guests: []
  }
}
```

Using Ruby, remove Belle from the town residents, and
add her to the list of guests in the castle.

Write your code here:
```ruby
# code here
```

### Question 3

Assume you have an array of strings representing friend's names:

```ruby
friends = ["Chip Potts", "Cogsworth", "Lumière", "Mrs. Potts"]
```

Using `.each` AND string interpolation, produce output (using `puts`) like so:

```
Belle is friends with Chip Potts
Belle is friends with Cogsworth
Belle is friends with Lumière
Belle is friends with Mrs. Potts
```

Write your code here:
```ruby
# code here
friends.each do |Chip Potts|
  puts Belle
```
## Ruby OOP (meets Lion King)

### Question 4

Create ruby classes for `Animal` and `Lion`.
Each `Animal` should have:

- a `name` attribute
- a `greet` instance method
- Getter and setter for `name`

Create a new `Animal` instance with the name "Pumba"

Make the `Lion` inherit from the `Animal` class.
The `Lion` class should have a `pack` class variable that holds references to each instance created.

Each lion should have:
- a `king` attribute which is a boolean
  - If the instance's `name` is `Simba` make the `king` attribute true

Create a new lion instance with the name `simba`

```ruby
class Animal
  attr_accessor @name
  def initialize @name, @greet
   @name = name
   @greet = greet
 end
  @name = "Pumba"
 end
 class Lion < Animal
   if @name == "Simba"
     puts @king == true

```

## SQL, Databases, and ActiveRecord (meets Aladdin)

### Question 5

Describe what an ERD is, and why we create them for applications. Also give an
example what the attributes and relationships might be for the following
entities (no need to draw an ERD):
* Genie
* Lamp
* Person
* Pet

Your answer:
```
An ERD is a model that we use to show graphically how different entities are related with one another.
We use them before building in order to help us determine how we want to go about creating
the program and how certain items will interact with one another.  An example would be to start with "Genie" and draw a line above and put "Person" because a genie is a person.  Genie also has a lamp and quite possibly a pet to those could also be represented by drawing another line out of genie and putting those two in that box.
```

### Question 6

Describe what a schema is, and how we represent a one-to-many relationship in a
SQL database. If you need an example, you can use: people and wishes
(one-to-many).

Your answer:
```
people: person_name,
wishes:
```
